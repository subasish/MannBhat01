## What's new

Two unique contributions:

1. XX
2. XX

The idea on high level is clear but the writing here is a bit unclear on details, of exactly how the sampling is done.

## The model

I find the paper's model description slightly wordy and unclear, but basically we're building a **differentiable nearest neighbor++**. The output \hat{y} for a test example \hat{x} is computed very similar to what you might see in Nearest Neighbors:![fig1](img/pap1/fig1.JPG)

## The bad

1. All tables, no graphics
2. Hard to digest
3. Tons of tables
